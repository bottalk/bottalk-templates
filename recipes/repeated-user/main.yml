# This is a very basic demo skill. 
# it checks whether you are a new or a repeated user
# save your name and next time greets you with your name
# then you can erase all information about you from the skill
# it was made for Alexa. To use it with Google please change slots/intents

                 It's a good idea to distinguish whether people already used your skill. Give them more infos at the start!
