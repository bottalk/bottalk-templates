This template allows you to build Alexa Skills / Google Action with the daily information.
Every day of the week users can learn something new from your Skill / Action: deals, news, currency rates etc.
It's very easy to customize: every day of the week has it's own step.
Just edit the content of the ***sendText*** and/or ***sendCard*** action - and you are ready to go!

```yaml
- name: Monday Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
          This is the placeholder for any text you want to send on Monday.

## [House Guest](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/house-guest)

Are you an Airbnb host? Or are your friends or relatives just staying over? In any case - use can create and publish (!) this scenario as an Alexa Skill / Google Action to help your guests feel just like at home.

Dialogue example:

> Alexa, open House Guest

> **Alexa**: Welcome to our home! Are you looking for something? Just ask! For example:
            "Where is TV remote?" or
            "How do I lock the door?" or
            "What is the number of the host?"

> What is the WiFi password?

> **Alexa**: The WiFi password is AF340i_4v

> How do I turn on the air conditioner?

> **Alexa**:  To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the wall.


How to customize the scenario?

1. Edit the ```slots.yml``` file in order to add things your guests might want to find or do:

```yaml
thing_to_find:
  - 'TV remote'
  - 'WiFi password'
thing_to_do:
  - 'lock the door'
  - 'turn on the air conditioner'
```

2. Edit the ```intetns.yml``` file and come up with the variations of how your guests could ask Alexa / Google Home for instructions:

```yaml
where_is:
  - 'Where is the {thing_to_find}'
how_do_i:
  - 'How do I {thing_to_do}'
contact:
  - 'Contact'
  - 'Contact information of the host'
  - 'Call the host'
  - 'What is the number of the host'
```

3. Edit the ```main.yml``` file to provide the answers to the guests' requests. For instance, that's how "How do I..." step looks like:

```yaml
- name: How Do I Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
        {% if thing_to_do == 'lock the door' %}
          You can lock the door with the digital key, using your mobile phone.
          Yes, we're very forward-thinking house.
        {% elseif thing_to_do == 'turn on the air conditioner' %}
          To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the well.
        {% endif %}
    - sendText: >
        Is there anything else I can do for you?
    - getInput:
  next:
    where_is: Where Is Step
    how_do_i: How Do I Step
    contact: Contact Step
```

## [Trivia Game](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/trivia-game)

With this template you can build any kind of trivia game you like. In this example we play the movies trivia.

Dialogue example:

> Alexa, open Trivia Template

> **Alexa**: [Audio Effect]
            Welcome to the most insightful movies trivia game in the whole wide world!
            Do you want to start a game?

> Yes, sure

> **Alexa**: Round One! Movie Quotes!
             I give you the quote, you give me movie it came from.
             The quote: [Pause]  “You can’t handle the truth!”
             Which movie is this?
             A League of Their Own
             The Sixth Sense
             or
             A Few Good Men?

> A Few Good Men

> **Alexa**:  [Audio Effect]
            That's correct!
            Your current score is 1 point.
            Are you ready for the second round?

### How to create your own trivia game?

1. To customize the game start with editing the **First Question** step in the main.yml file:

```yaml
- name: First Question
  actions:
    - sendCard:
        title: BotTalk Trivia Template
        text: >
            Which movie is the quote "You can’t handle the truth!" from? {{ '\n\n' | raw }}

            - A League of Their Own {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - The Sixth Sense {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - A Few Good Men? {{ '\n' | raw }}
        image: 'https://bottalk.de/img/bottalk_landing_logo.png'
    - sendText: >
        Round One! Movie Quotes!
        I give you the quote, you give me movie it came from.
        The quote: <break time="1s"/>  “You can’t handle the truth!”
        Which movie is this?
        A League of Their Own
        The Sixth Sense
        or
        A Few Good Men?
    - getInput:
  next:
    first_question_answer: Check First Question
```
2. Then move on and add **first_question_answer** in the intents.yml file:

```yaml
first_question_answer:
  - '{first_question_answer_movie}'
  - 'The name of the movie was {first_question_answer_movie}'
```

3. Finish the step with editing the slots.yml and putting the **first_question_answer_movie** in - that would be your answers

```yaml
first_question_answer_movie:
  - a league of their own
  - the sixth sense
  - a few good men
```

4. To check if the answer was correct edit the **Check First Question** step in the main.yml file:

```yaml
- name: Check First Question
  actions:
    - compareContext:
        var: '{{ first_question_answer_movie | lower }}'
        is_equal: 'a few good men'
  next:
    'true': First Question Correct
    'false': First Question Incorrect
```

And just keep building your amazing game from here!

## [Things To Do](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/things-to-do)

Are you at home and wondering what to do? What movie to watch? What errand to run? Or just want an idea for a healthy family dinner? Then this scenario is for you!

Dialogue Example:

> Alexa, open What To Do

> **Alexa**:  Welcome to Things to Do!
              I can help you choose what to do next. Just pick a category.
              What will it be? Movies, Errands or Dinner?

> What are the top movies?

> **Alexa**:  Hm, let's see... The top movies on NetFlix this week are:
              - The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan,
              - Star Wars: The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson,
              - Set It Up by Claire Scanlon and
              - Ex Machina by Nicholas Stoller

## How to create your own What To Do Alexa Skill / Google Home Action?

1. To customize the scenario start with editing the first `Initial step`

```yaml
  # This is the start of our scenario
  # If the step is put first - it will also be executed first
  - name: Initial step
    actions:
      # That's what Alexa will say to the user
      - sendText: >
          Welcome to Things to Do!
          I can help you choose what to do next. Just pick a category.
          What will it be? Movies, Errands or Dinner?
      # That's what we will show in Alexa Show or as Google Action Card
      # Each card has a title, text and image.
      - sendCard:
          title: Things to Do
          text: >
            Welcome to Things to Do!
            I can help you choose what to do next. Just pick a cateogory.
            What will it be?  {{ '\n' | raw }} {{ '\n' | raw }}

            - Movies {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - Errands {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - Dinner {{ '\n' | raw }}

          image: 'https://bottalk.de/img/bottalk_landing_logo.png'
      # When the user will not answer the following question correctly,
      # Alexa / Google Home could politely ask again - or reprompt
      - reprompt: >
          In order for me to suggest what you might wanna do,
          I need you to choose the category first: Movies, Errands or Dinner?
      # Here we are waiting for the user to answer our question
      - getInput:
```

2. Then Move on to the Intents secion and define a `choose_category` intent:

```yaml
choose_category:
  - '{category_name}'
```

3. Define the categories in your Slots section:

```yaml
---
slots:
  category_name:
    - 'movies'
    - 'errands'
    - 'dinner'
```

4. To make your skill more *human* introduce several intents that would *sound* like a human might say it in the free conversational manner:

```yaml
movies_intent:
  - 'what movies should i watch'
  - 'what are the top movies'
  - 'best movies'

dinner_intent:
  - 'what to cook for dinner'
  - 'what to cook today'
  - 'dinner ideas'
```

5. Finally introduce `when` - `else` [Conditional Step](https://bottalk.de/docs/#/?id=decision-making-conditional-steps) to help your skill decide which TODO item to choose from:

```yaml
  # In this step we do some conditional logic
  - name: Check If Category Is Movies
    # A user can initiate this step from ANYWHERE
    entrypoint: true
    # We first check if the user has chosen a category intent - and if so - if the category she chose is movies
    # If not - then maybe the user invoked the movies_intent directly by saying something like 'what movies should i watch'
    # To check that we use internal variable lastMessage which gives us the name of the last intent by the user
    when: 'category_name == "movies" or lastMessage == "movies_intent"'
    # WHEN the condition above is correct all of the following will be executed
    actions:
      - sendText: >
          {{ category_name }} and {{ lastMessage }}
          Hm, let's see... The top movies on NetFlix this week are:

          The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan,
          Star Wars: The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson,
          Set It Up by Claire Scanlon and
          Ex Machina by Nicholas Stoller

          What do you want to do next?
      - sendCard:
          title: Top Movies This Week
          text: >
            {{ category_name }} and {{ lastMessage }}

            - The Dark Knight by Christopher Nolan {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - Star Wars: The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - Set It Up by Claire Scanlon {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - Ex Machina by Nicholas Stoller {{ '\n' | raw }} {{ '\n' | raw }}

      - reprompt: >
          In order for me to suggest what you might wanna do,
          I need you to choose the category first: Movies, Errands or Dinner?
      - getInput:
    next:
      movies_intent: Check If Category Is Movies
      errands_intent:  Check If Category Is Errands
      dinner_intent: Check If Category Is Dinner
      choose_category: Check If Category Is Movies
      # ELSE: The codition above was NOT correct - then we've got to move to the next step - where we make similar checks
      else: Check If Category Is Errands
```
